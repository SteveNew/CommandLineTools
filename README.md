# Command line tools

In the years I have been programming, I have written many command line tools. Most of them were useful but have been 
superseded by tools that came with the operating system. But some have survived, and so I kept them. I want to share 
some of them with you.

<dl>
  <dt>whereis</dt> 
  <dd>A tool which tries to find which executable (or executables) will be called if you enter its name on the command line.</dd>
  <dt>slack</dt>
  <dd>A tool which calculates the disk space wasted, because of cluster size, on the files in a certain directory.</dd>
  <dt>echoc</dt>
  <dd>A simple tool to display a string in different colours.</dd>
  <dt>cal</dt>
  <dd>A tool which prints the calendar for one or more months to the screen.</dd>
  <dt>exact</dt>
  <dd>A tool to show the exact values of floating point variables in single, double and extended precision and in hex.</dd>
</dl>
